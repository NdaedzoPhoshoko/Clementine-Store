Gateway server-side integration:
- No endpoint that creates a gateway session/intent and returns client params (e.g., Stripe client_secret , or PayFast redirect URL).
- No webhook endpoint to receive provider callbacks and update payments.payment_status and orders.payment_status='PAID' .
- No signature validation of webhook events
