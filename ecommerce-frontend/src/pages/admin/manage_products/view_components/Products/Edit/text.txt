Add success/error toasts on save and upload.

- Separate image operations from the main product update

- Keep product fields ( name , price , etc.) in the PUT /api/products/:id .
- Manage images via dedicated endpoints to avoid touching unchanged images:
  - Upload new: POST /api/products/:id/images (multipart)
  - Delete existing: DELETE /api/products/:id/images/:imageId
  - Replace existing: PUT /api/products/:id/images/:imageId (multipart) or delete+upload
  - Reorder: PUT /api/products/:id/images/order with an ordered array of image IDs
  - Set primary (thumbnail): PUT /api/products/:id with image_url
- Track a baseline and compute deltas

- On load, capture the baseline from useFetchProductDetails :
  - Primary from product.image_url
  - Existing images list (prefer each image to have an id and image_url )
- Maintain local state for the current working set:
  - Existing images: keep their id and image_url
  - New images: mark with temporary IDs (e.g., temp:<uuid> ) and store File for upload
- On save:
  - Upload only new temp images
  - Call delete for removed existing images
  - Call replace for explicit replacements
  - Call reorder if order changed
  - Call setPrimary only if the primary changed
- This ensures unchanged images are untouched and the backend sees only the minimal set of changes.
