Short Flow

- Request OTP (frontend → backend)
  
  - Frontend calls POST /api/auth/forgot-password with email .
  - Backend verifies the email exists, generates a 6‑digit OTP, stores its bcrypt hash and a 10‑minute expiry, then returns { passcode, time } to the frontend.
  - Frontend uses EmailJS to send the email with {{email}} , {{passcode}} , and {{time}} aka expiry time .

  note emails must be sent for OTP, placing orders, and order change of status
