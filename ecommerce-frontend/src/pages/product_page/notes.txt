take note:
When i build the upload product pages i must use image compression technique using react library react-image-file-resizer.
it is involved in front end so that every image must pass through this compression during file upload. 
maybe let it compress images whose sizes is above 0.99mb

also note, when building ui for uploading images, i must allow them to choose color on a color picker then upload images for that product
this will allow users to choose color of clothe then preview on the product details page before adding to cart.
