take note:
When i build the upload product pages i must use image compression technique using react library react-image-file-resizer.
it is involved in front end so that every image must pass through this compression during file upload. 
maybe let it compress images whose sizes is above 0.99mb

also note, when building ui for uploading images, i must allow them to choose color on a color picker then upload images for that product
this will allow users to choose color of clothe then preview on the product details page before adding to cart.

add script for table variant for products
CREATE TABLE product_variants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    color_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    color_hex TEXT CHECK (color_hex ~ '^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$'),
    image_url TEXT,
    price NUMERIC(10,2),
    stock INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_variants_product_id ON product_variants(product_id);

add endpoints 
GET /api/products/:id → single product + its variants (colors, sizes, etc.)
POST /api/products/:id/variants → add a new color variant
PUT /api/products/:id/variants/:variantId

On your product page:
Fetch the product with all variants.
Display color options as swatches (buttons or color circles).
When a user clicks a color:
Change the main product image.
Update price and stock if different.
When implementing the admin side for uploading products- make sure that you look at UI for pruduct since dimensions needs to be added, care notes, additional details
